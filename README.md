## Concepts Covered

### Section A: Variable Scope
- Local vs Global Variables
- Formal Parameters
- Method Scope

### Section B: Data Types
- Primitive Data Types
- Type Conversion
- Common Error Fixing

### Section C: Operators
- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators

## How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites
- .NET SDK (version 6.0 or higher)
- Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, or any C# IDE

### Running the Solution
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NickiMash17/CSharp-Learning-Journey.git
cd CSharp-Learning-Journey
```

2. Build the solution
```bash
dotnet build
```

3. Run the main program
```bash
dotnet run
```

### Running Individual Sections
You can run individual sections directly:
```bash
dotnet run --project src/SectionA/SectionA.csproj
dotnet run --project src/SectionB/SectionB.csproj
dotnet run --project src/SectionC/SectionC.csproj
dotnet run --project src/Challenges/Challenges.csproj
```

## Learning Resources

Here are some resources I found useful during my learning journey:

- [Microsoft C# Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
- [C# Corner](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/)
- [W3Schools C# Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/)
- [GeeksforGeeks C# Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/csharp-programming-language/)

## Next Steps in My Learning Journey

After completing these exercises, I plan to explore:
- Object-Oriented Programming in C#
- Collections and LINQ
- File I/O Operations
- Asynchronous Programming
- .NET Web Development
